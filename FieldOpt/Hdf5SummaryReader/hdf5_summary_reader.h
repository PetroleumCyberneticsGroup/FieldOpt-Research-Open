/*!
 * The Hdf5SummaryReader class reads the summaries written
 * in the HDF5 format by the AD-GPRS reservoir simulator.
 *
 * Currently the class supports getting rates and cumulatives
 * for each well and for the field, as well as bottom hole
 * pressures and well type for each well.
 *
 * Note that we do not have access to the well names in the
 * summary, thus we use well numbers. This number corresponds
 * to the row on which information about the well is found.
 * This number apparentlydoes not correspond to the order in
 * which the wells were specified in the driver file, thus we
 * have no way of distinguishing wells other that by producer
 * /injector. Note also that we do not know whether the order
 * in which the wells appear can change between subsequent
 * runs of the simulator.
 *
 * Note also that when you get the rates for an injector using
 * the get_*_rates methods, the numbers will be negative, whereas
 * if you get them using the get_*_injection_rates methods, they
 * will be positive.
 *
 * \todo This must also be tested for a 3 phase black oil model,
 * it has only been tested for 2 phase dead oil.
 *
 * \todo Overall, Hdf5SummaryReader::readSaturation needs a better 
 * implementation that reads soil and sgas at the same time/as a 
 * single chunck from the H5 group, instead of reading from H5 one 
 * vector at a time (the thinking is that the former is probably
 * more efficient that the latter).
 * In either case, the reading functionality needs to be flexible/
 * /robust with respect to the different phase combinations that 
 * might exist in the H5 group (currently GRIDPROPTIME), e.g., 
 * soil/sgas, soil/sgas/swat, soil/swat, etc.
 *
 * \todo To make thing much tidier, collect variables containing 
 * information about the reservoir cell ensemble, i.e., 
 * cells_all_vector_, cells_active_, cells_inactive_, etc, and of
 * reservoir cell data, i.e., pressure_, soil_, sgas_, swat_, into 
 * one or more reservoir cells/cell data structs.
 *
 * \todo Later: to reduce the size of the H5 file, make ADGPRS/
 * Optimizer save the saturation data (and whatever else) as 
 * additional columns into the existing PTZ group (possibly 
 * replacing current mobility columns), and remove GRIDPROPTIME 
 * completely. 
 * Additionally, which cell data types (including custom data 
 * types) to print to H5 during simulation may be controlled by 
 * custom simulator KEYWORD.
