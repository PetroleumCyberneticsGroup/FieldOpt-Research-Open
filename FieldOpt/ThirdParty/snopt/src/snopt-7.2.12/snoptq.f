*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*     snOptQ    solves the linear/quadratic programming problem
*
*     Min/max     ObjAdd + <a(iObj),x> + <cObj,x> + half <x,H*x>
*        x
*     subject to linear constraints, and upper and lower bounds on x
*     (see below).
*
*     ObjAdd  is a constant scalar.
*     a(iObj) is the iObj-th row of the constraint matrix A (see below).
*     cObj    is a constant vector.
*     H       is a constant symmetric matrix, defined implicitly in the
*             user-supplied subroutine qpHx.
*             o Subroutine qpHx must evaluate products of H with a given
*               vector x. This implies that H is defined as an operator,
*               and need never be defined explicitly.
*             o If H has zero rows and columns, it is most efficient to
*               order the variables so that
*                      Hx = ( H1  0 )( X1 ) = ( H1 x1 ),
*                           ( 0   0 )( X2)    (   0   )
*               where the nonlinear variables x1 appear first as shown.
*
*     The constraints take the form
*
*                            (  x )
*                      bl <= (    ) <= bu,
*                            ( Ax )
*
*     where bl and bu are constant lower and upper bounds.
*
*     Internally, the constraints are rewritten as
*
*                                         ( x )
*                   Ax - s = 0,     bl <= (   ) <= bu,
*                                         ( s )
*
*     where s is an m-vector of slack variables.
*     components of (x,s) are the variables and slacks respectively.
*     The sparse matrix A is entered column-wise in the arrays
*     Acol, indA, locA (below).
*
*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*     NOTE: Before calling snOptQ, the calling program must call:
*     call sqInit( iPrint, iSumm,
*    &             cw, lencw, iw, leniw, rw, lenrw )
*     This sets the default values of the optional parameters. You can
*     also alter the default values of iPrint and iSumm before snOptQ
*     is used.  iPrint = 0, etc, is OK.
*     ------------------------------------------------------------------
*
*     ON ENTRY:
*
*     Start   specifies how a starting basis (and certain other items)
*             are to be obtained.
*             Start = 'Cold' means that Crash should be used to choose
*                      an initial basis, unless a basis file is given
*                      via Old basis, Insert or Load in the Specs file.
*             Start = 'Basis file' means the same (but is more
*                      meaningful in the latter case).
*             Start = 'Warm' means that a basis is already defined in hs
*                      (probably from an earlier call).
*
*     m       is the number of rows in the constraint matrix A.
*             m > 0.
*
*     n       is the number of variables, excluding slacks.
*             For LP problems, this is the number of columns in A.
*             n > 0.
*
*     ne      is the number of nonzero entries in A.
*             ne > 0.
*
*     nName   is the number of column and row names provided in the
*             array  Names.  If nName = 1, there are NO names.
*             Generic names will be used in the printed solution.
*             Otherwise, nName = n+m and all names must be provided.
*
*     lencObj is the number of elements in the constant objective cObj.
*             lencObj ge 0.
*
*     ncolH   is the number of leading nonzero columns of the
*             QP Hessian.
*             If ncolH > 0, the subroutine qpHx must provide the
*             matrix-product Hx.
*             ncolH ge 0.
*
*     iObj    says which row of A is a free row containing a linear
*             objective vector  cObj  (iObj = 0 if none).
*             iObj = 0  or  iObj le m.
*
*     ObjAdd  is a constant that will be added to the objective before
*             printing.  Typically,  ObjAdd = 0.0d+0.
*
*     Prob    is an 8-character name for the problem, used in the
*             output.  A blank name can be assigned if necessary.
*
*     Acol(ne) is the constraint matrix, stored column-wise.
*
*     indA(ne) is the list of row indices for each nonzero in a(*).
*
*     locA(n+1) is a set of pointers to the beginning of each column of
*             the constraint matrix within Acol(*) and indA(*).
*             MUST HAVE locA(1) = 1 AND locA(n+1) = ne+1.
*
*  NOTES:  1. If lencObj > 0, the first lencObj columns of Acol and indA belong
*             to variables corresponding to the constant
*             objective term c.
*
*          2. If the problem has a quadratic objective,
*             The first ncolH columns of Acol and indA belong to variables
*             corresponding to the nonzero block of the QP Hessian.
*             Subroutine qpHx deals with these variables.
*
*          3. If lencObj > 0 and ncolH > 0, the two sets of
*             objective variables overlap.  The total number of
*             objective variables is nQP = max( lencObj, ncolH ).
*
*          4. The row indices indA(k) for a column may be in any order.
*
*     bl(n+m) is the lower bounds on the variables and slacks (x, s).
*
*     bu(n+m) is the upper bounds on (x, s).
*
*     Names(nName) is an character*8 array.
*             If nName =  1, Names is not used.  The printed solution
*             will use generic names for the columns and row.
*             If nName = n+m, Names(j) should contain an 8 character
*             name of the jth variable (j = 1, n+m).
*             If j = n+i, the jth variable is the ith row.
*
*     hEtype(n+m) indicate if the variable can violate its bound in
*             Elastic mode.
*             if hEtype(j) = 0, variable j is non-elastic and must not
*                               be violated.
*             if hEtype(j) = 1, variable j can violate its lower bound.
*             if hEtype(j) = 2, variable j can violate its upper bound.
*             if hEtype(j) = 3, variable j can violate either its
*                                          lower or upper bound.
*
*     hs(n+m) sometimes contains a set of initial states for each
*             variable (x, s).  See the following NOTES.
*
*     x(n+m)  is a set of initial values for each variable (x, s).
*
*  NOTES:  1. If Start = 'Cold' or 'Basis file' and a BASIS file
*             of some sort is to be input
*             (an OLD BASIS file, INSERT file or LOAD file),
*             hs and x need not be set at all.
*
*          2. Otherwise, hs(1:n) must be defined for a cold start.
*             If nothing special is known about the problem, or if
*             there is no wish to provide special information,
*             you may set hs(j) = 0, x(j) = 0.0d+0 for all j=1:n.
*             All variables will be eligible for the initial basis.
*
*             Less trivially, to say that variable j will probably
*             be equal to one of its bounds,
*             set hs(j) = 4 and x(j) = bl(j)
*             or  hs(j) = 5 and x(j) = bu(j) as appropriate.
*
*          3. For Cold starts with no basis file, a Crash procedure
*             is used to select an initial basis.  The initial basis
*             matrix will be triangular (ignoring certain small
*             entries in each column).
*             The values hs(j) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have the following
*             meaning:
*
*             hs(j)    State of variable j during Crash
*
*             0, 1, 3  Eligible for the basis.  3 is given preference.
*             2, 4, 5  Ignored.
*
*             After Crash, hs(j) = 2 entries are made superbasic.
*             Other entries not selected for the basis are made
*             nonbasic at the value x(j) if bl(j) <= x(j) <= bu(j),
*             or at the value bl(j) or bu(j) closest to x(j).
*
*          4. For Warm starts, all of hs(1:n+m) is assumed to be
*             set to the values 0, 1, 2 or 3 from some previous call.
*
*     nS      need not be specified for Cold starts,
*             but should retain its value from a previous call
*             when a Warm start is used.
*
*
*     ON EXIT:
*
*     hs(n+m) is the final state vector:
*
*                hs(j)    State of variable j    Normal value of x(j)
*
*                  0      nonbasic               bl(j)
*                  1      nonbasic               bu(j)
*                  2      superbasic             Between bl(j) and bu(j)
*                  3      basic                  ditto
*
*             Very occasionally there may be nonbasic variables for
*             which x(j) lies strictly between its bounds.
*             If nInf = 0, basic and superbasic variables may be outside
*             their bounds by as much as the Feasibility tolerance.
*             Note that if Scale is specified, the Feasibility tolerance
*             applies to the variables of the SCALED problem.
*             In this case, the variables of the original problem may be
*             as much as 0.1 outside their bounds, but this is unlikely
*             unless the problem is very badly scaled.
*
*     x(n+m)  is the final variables and slacks (x, s).
*
*     pi(m)   is the vector of Lagrange multipliers (shadow prices)
*             for the general constraints.
*
*     rc(n+m) is a vector of reduced costs: rc = g - (A -I)'*pi, where g
*             is the gradient of the objective if x is feasible
*             (or the gradient of the Phase 1 objective otherwise).
*             If nInf = 0, the last m entries are pi.
*
*     INFO    says what happened; see the User's Guide.
*             The possible values are as follows:
*
*             INFO    Meaning

*
*     mincw   says how much character storage is needed to solve the
*             problem.  If INFO = 82, the work array cw(lencw) was
*             too small.  sqOpt may be called again with lencw suitably
*             larger than mincw.
*
*     miniw   says how much integer storage is needed to solve the
*             problem.  If INFO = 83, the work array iw(leniw) was too
*             small.  sqOpt may be called again with leniw suitably
*             larger than miniw.  (The bigger the better, since it is
*             not certain how much storage the basis factors need.)
*
*     minrw   says how much real storage is needed to solve the
*             problem.  If INFO = 84, the work array rw(lenrw) was too
*             small.  (See the comments above for miniw.)
*
*     nS      is the final number of superbasics.
*
*     nInf    is the number of infeasibilities.
*
*     sInf    is the sum    of infeasibilities.
*
*     Obj     is the value of the QP objective function.
*             Obj does NOT include ObjAdd or the objective row.
*             If nInf = 0, Obj includes the quadratic objective if any.
*             If nInf > 0, Obj is just the linear objective if any.
*
*     cu(lencu), iu(leniu), ru(lenru)  are character, integer and real
*             arrays of USER workspace.  These arrays are available to
*             pass data to the user-defined routine qpHx.
*             If no workspace is required, you can either use dummy
*             arrays for cu, iu and ru, or use cw, iw and rw
*             (see below).
*
*     cw(lencw), iw(leniw), rw(lenrw)  are character*8, integer and real
*             arrays of workspace used by SNOPTQ.
*             lencw  should be about at least 500.
*             leniw  should be about max( 500, 10(m+n) ) or larger.
*             lenrw  should be about max( 500, 20(m+n) ) or larger.

*     snKerQ does the work for snOptQ. (i.e., its the kernel for sqopt)
*
*     Developers can call snKerQ with customized versions of sqLog.
*
*     04 Jan 2005: First version of snKerQ.
*     01 Sep 2007: Sticky parameters added.
*     04 Jul 2010: mincw, miniw, minrw added to workspace.
