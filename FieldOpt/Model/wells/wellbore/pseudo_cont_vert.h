/*!
 * @brief This class holds a representation of a vertical well that can be placed with
 * "pseudo-continuous" variables. By this we mean that the position is determined by
 * continuous variables in the xyz coordinate-system in the reservoir, but they are
 * converted into IJK indices and the well indices are defaulted when they are passed
 * to the simulator. Put simply, this implies that all wells will be assumed to be at
 * the center of the block that contains the xyz-coordinate, and that they fully
 * penetrate that block.
 *
 * For now, this class only considers x and y coordinates, and it assumes that only
 * one block (the topmost) is penetrated in the vertical direction. This means that
 * it's best suited for 2D reservoirs.
 *
 * Note that this class uses the depth of cell 1,1,1 as the z-coordinate when getting
 * the cell containing the xy-point, so reservoirs that don't have a flat top layer
 * will be problematic.
