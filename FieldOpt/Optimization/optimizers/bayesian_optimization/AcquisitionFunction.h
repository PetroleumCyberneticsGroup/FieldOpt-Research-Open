 * @brief This class is an implementation of an AcquisitionFunction. It is
 * used in Bayesian Optimization algorithms to determine which point should
 * be evaluated next.
 *
 * It takes as input coordinate vector x, and returns a weighted sum of the
 * expected value at x and the variance at x.
 *
 * Weighing the expected value component higher will result in faster convergence
 * and less exploration (thus increasing the risk that we will miss the global
 * optimum); while wighing the variance component higher will result in more
 * exploration (this giving slower convergence and reducing the risk that we
 * will miss the true global optimum).
