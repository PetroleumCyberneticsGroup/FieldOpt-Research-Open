/*!
 * @brief This file contains verbosity level settings for all modules in FieldOpt.
 * FieldOpt has to be recompiled after changing these settings.
 *
 * Level descriptions (they are additive):
 *     0 - Silent (only errors)
 *     1 - Only warnings and rudimentary progression (once pr. iteration).
 *     2 - More progression priting.
 *     3 - Debug-level printing. It is not recommended to use this level on more than one module at a time.
