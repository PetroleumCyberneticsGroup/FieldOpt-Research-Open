# FieldOpt
Petroleum Field Development Optimization Framework.

FieldOpt is a C++ programming framework implemented for rapid prototyping and testing of optimization procedures
targeting petroleum field development problems such as well placement optimization, reservoir control optimization 
and inflow-control device optimization. FieldOpt is an ongoing open-source research software designed to facilitate 
collaboration projects.  

FieldOpt contributes to research workflows by providing an extensible framework that facilitates both problem 
parametrization and customized algorithm development. It serves as a practical interface between optimization 
methodology and reservoir simulation enabling the hybridization of algorithms and the use of different reservoir 
simulators. Its execution layer provides efficient cost function parallelization across multiple realizations.
