This directory contains the input data file and results produced by
several simulation software packages of the Norne Benchmark Case [1].

Modification: 
(1) Region is set explicitly to FLUXNUM in MULTREGT. 
*The default in MULTREGT is to use MULTNUM, but MULTNUM is not provided in the Norne deck. Eclipse uses FLUXNUM as a fallback in case MULTNUM is not specified. 
The same fallback solution is on purpose not supported in OPM 
(2) The SWOF and SGOF tables are modified to get reasonable scanning curves for 3-pt scaling in Eclipse. More precisely, values for the critical saturation is added explicitly in the tables.
